# Hello Dojo

> This section assumes that you have already installed the Dojo toolchain and are familiar with Cairo. If not, please refer to the [Getting Started](../getting-started/quick-start.md) section.

## Dojo in 15 Minutes

Think of Dojo as an abstraction over Cairo, similar to how React is to JavaScript. It enables you to write shorthand commands that expand into complex queries during compile time. Dojo is grounded in the well-known architecture known as the Entity Component System (ECS).

In Dojo, you design your worlds using Systems and Components. Systems outline the logic of your world, while components signify the state. This powerful pattern allows you to structure your logic in a highly modular way. If you don't understand this yet, don't fret; we'll delve into it in detail below.

To start, let's set up a project to run locally on your machine. From an empty directory, execute:

```console
sozo init
```

Congratulations! You now have a local Dojo project. This command creates a `dojo-starter` project in your current directory. It's the ideal starting point for a new project and equips you with everything you need to begin.

#### Anatomy of a Dojo Project

Inspect the contents of the `dojo-starter` project, and you'll notice the following structure (excluding the non-cairo files):

```bash
src
  - components.cairo
  - systems.cairo
  - lib.cairo
Scarb.toml
```

Dojo projects largely resemble standard Cairo projects, with the distinction being some special attribute tags you use when creating `Components` and `Systems`. Let's explore this next.

Open the `src/components.cairo` file to continue.

```rust,ignore
#[derive(Component, Copy, Drop, Serde, SerdeLen)]
struct Moves {
    #[key]
    player: ContractAddress,
    remaining: u8,
}

#[derive(Component, Copy, Drop, Serde, SerdeLen)]
struct Position {
    #[key]
    player: ContractAddress,
    x: u32,
    y: u32
}

...rest of code
```

Notice the `#[derive(Component, Copy, Drop, Serde, SerdeLen)]` attributes. For a component to be recognized, we *must* include `Component`. This signals to the Dojo compiler that this struct should be treated as a component.

Our `Moves` component houses a `remaining` value in its state. The `#[key]` attribute informs Dojo that this component is indexed by the `player` field. If this is unfamiliar to you, we'll clarify its importance later in the chapter. Essentially, it implies that you can query this component using the `player` field.

In a similar vein, we possess a `Position` component that holds `x` and `y` values. Once again, this component is indexed by the `player` field.

Now, let's examine the `src/systems.cairo` file:

```rust,ignore
#[system]
mod spawn {
    use array::ArrayTrait;
    use box::BoxTrait;
    use traits::Into;
    use dojo::world::Context;

    use dojo_examples::components::Position;
    use dojo_examples::components::Moves;

    fn execute(ctx: Context) {
        let position = get!(ctx.world, ctx.origin, (Position));
        set!(
            ctx.world,
            (
                Moves {
                    player: ctx.origin, remaining: 10
                },
                Position {
                    player: ctx.origin, x: position.x + 10, y: position.y + 10
                },
            )
        );
        return ();
    }
}
```

Let us break this down:

```rust,ignore
#[system]
```

Just as we use the `#[derive(Component)]` attribute, the `#[system]` attribute informs the Dojo compiler that this struct is a system, instructing it to compile accordingly.

```rust,ignore
fn execute(ctx: Context)
```

You'll observe that the system features an `execute` function. It's crucial to note that all Dojo systems necessitate an `execute` function. This function accepts a `Context` as its parameter. The `Context` is a distinct struct that provides information about the world and the caller.

It's worth mentioning that a system can contain more than just the `execute` function. You're free to include numerous functions as needed. However, the `execute` function is mandatory since it's invoked when your system is executed.

Now lets look at the next line:

```rust,ignore
let position = get!(ctx.world, ctx.origin, (Position));
```

Here we use `get!` [command](./commands.md) to retrieve the `Position` component for the `ctx.origin` entity. `ctx.origin` is the address of the caller. When called for the first time, it will return:

```rust,ignore
Position {
  player: 0x0, // zero address
  x: 0,
  y: 0
}
```

Now the next line:

```rust,ignore
set!(
    ctx.world,
    (
        Moves {
            player: ctx.origin, remaining: 10
            }, Position {
            player: ctx.origin, x: position.x + 10, y: position.y + 10
        },
    )
);
```

Here we use the `set!` [command](./commands.md) to set the `Moves` and `Position` components for the `ctx.origin` entity.

We covered a lot here in a short time. Let's recap:

-   Explained the anatomy of a Dojo project
-   Explained the importace of the `#[derive(Component)]` and `#[system]` attribute
-   Explained the `execute` function
-   Explained the `Context` struct
-   Touched on the `get!` and `set!` commands


### Run it locally!

Now that we have some theory out of the way, lets build the Dojo project!

```bash
sozo build
```

That compiled the components and system into an artifact that can be deployed! Simple as that!

Now lets deploy it to [Katana](../toolchain/katana/overview.md)! First we need to get Katana running:

```bash
katana --disable-fee
```

Success! [Katana](../toolchain/katana/overview.md) should now be running locally on your machine. Now lets deploy!

```bash
sozo migrate --name test
```

This will deploy the artifact to [Katana](../toolchain/katana/overview.md). You should see terminal output similar to this:

```bash
Migration account: 0x33c627a3e5213790e246a917770ce23d7e562baa5b4d2917c23b1be6d91961c

ðŸŽ‰ Successfully migrated World on block #4 at address 0x71b95a2c000545624c51813444b57dbcdcc153dfc79b6b0e3a9a536168d1e16
```

Your ðŸŒŽ is now deployed at `0x71b95a2c000545624c51813444b57dbcdcc153dfc79b6b0e3a9a536168d1e16`!

Let's discuss the `Scarb.toml` file in the project. This file contains environment variables that make running CLI commands in your project a breeze. (Read more about it [here](./config.md)).

Add the world address to the bottom of the file:

```toml
world_address = "0x71b95a2c000545624c51813444b57dbcdcc153dfc79b6b0e3a9a536168d1e16"
```

This establishes the world address for your project. You can then run commands like:

```bash
sozo execute spawn
```

By doing so, you've just activated the spawn system. You now have a local world that you can interact with.

### Indexing

With your local world set up, let's delve into indexing. You can index the entire world with this simple command:

```bash
torii
```

Executing the above activates a local torii server using SQLite as its database, which is exposed at `http://0.0.0.0:8080`. It will automatically index your world into tables, allowing you to query them using GraphQL.

We've covered quite a bit! Here's a recap:

-   Built a Dojo world
-   Deployed the project to Katana
-   Ran the spawn system locally
-   Indexed the world with Torii

### Next Steps

This overview provides a rapid end-to-end glimpse into Dojo. However, the potential of these worlds is vast! Designed to manage hundreds of systems and components, Dojo is equipped for expansive creativity. So, what will you craft next?
