## ERC20

Dojo's ERC20 module is a standard implementation of the ERC20 token standard, but it utilizes Dojo Systems and Components. This allows us to leverage the excellent properties of the ERC20 standard and use it natively within the Dojo environment.

### Integration into Your World

To integrate the ERC20 module into your world, you must first deploy the ERC20 Dojo contract. Subsequently, install the systems and components into your world.
