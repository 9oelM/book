## Dojo Modules

With standardization of Systems and Components we can create a module architecture for Dojo. This allows us to create reusable modules that can be used in any Dojo world.

### Module Architecture

Think of modules as ERCs for Dojo. They are a standard way to create and share functionality. Modules are a collection of Systems and Components that can be imported into a Dojo world. Dojo is following the ERC patterns and has modules already defined for ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155.
