## Quick Start

> It is worth reading [theory](../theory/autonomous-worlds.md) to familiarize yourself with the concept of Autonomous Worlds (AWs) and the [Cairo ecosystem](../theory/cairo.md) before diving into the code.


### Install Dojoup

Dojo is built around a set of development tools - Katana, Torii and Sozo. Install them all easily with Dojoup. You can find detailed information about Dojoup [here](https://github.com/dojoengine/dojo/blob/master/dojoup/README.md).

```sh
curl -L https://install.dojoengine.org | bash
```

This will install Dojoup, then simply follow the instructions on-screen,
which will make the `dojoup` command available in your CLI.

```sh
dojoup
```

For full `dojoup` reference and debugging see [Dojoup](../toolchain/dojoup.md).
